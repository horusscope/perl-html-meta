# perl-html-meta
Use LWP::UserAgent Mojo::DOM and JSON::XS to retrieve HTML &lt;meta> tags from a remote webpage.

OSX:
type "cpan" to run the immediate installer
in the cpan command line, install each of these things with "install $name" such as "install YAML"
do that for the following items:

YAML
Module::Metadata
HTML::Entities
Digest::MD5
HTML::HeadParser
CPAN::Meta::Requirements
LWP::UserAgent
Mojo::DOM
JSON::XS
Data::Dumper

After that you will be ready to parse HTML documents with XPath in perl.
